* **Book:** *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* — **Aurélien Géron**
* **Project Checkpoint:** Build and deploy a full ML pipeline using scikit-learn (data → model → evaluation → API)

### Week 17–20: Deep Learning Fundamentals

* **Option 1 (Applied):** *Practical Deep Learning for Coders* — **fast.ai**
* **Option 2 (Theory + Applied):** *Deep Learning Specialization* — **Andrew Ng**, Coursera
* **Project Checkpoint:** Train and deploy CNN for image classification, RNN/transformer for text data

### Week 21–24: Hands-On ML Deployment

* **Resources:** Gradio / Streamlit documentation, Flask tutorials
* **Project Checkpoint:** Demo a model in production (simple API + interactive frontend)

---

## Phase 3 — Specialization: NLP, LLMs & Agents (Weeks 25–36)

### Week 25–28: NLP & Transformers

* **Course:** *CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning* — **Stanford University**, Online Lectures
* **Course:** *Hugging Face Learn* (Transformers & LLM Labs)
* **Project Checkpoint:** Fine-tune a transformer on domain-specific dataset, build small text generation model

### Week 29–32: LLM Apps & Retrieval

* **Resources:** *OpenAI Cookbook* — GitHub
* **Course:** *LangChain for Developers* — **Harrison Chase / DeepLearning.AI**
* **Project Checkpoint:** Build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant with embeddings + vector DB (Pinecone or Chroma)

### Week 33–36: Agents & Orchestration

* **Course:** *Master AI Agents in 30 Days* — **Ed Donner**, Udemy
* **Project Checkpoint:** Build multi-agent workflow (e.g., research agent + summarizer + email agent), document architecture decisions

---

## Phase 4 — MLOps & Production Engineering (Weeks 37–48)

### Week 37–40: MLOps Fundamentals

* **Course:** *Machine Learning in Production* — **DeepLearning.AI**, Coursera
* **Reading:** *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* — **Martin Kleppmann**
* **Tools to Learn:** Docker, Kubernetes basics, CI/CD, MLflow, monitoring, vector DBs
* **Project Checkpoint:** Deploy model as service with CI/CD, monitoring, and retraining pipeline

### Week 41–48: Capstone & Portfolio

* **Capstone Project:** Combine ML, NLP, LLM, Agents, and MLOps knowledge in a full-stack AI application
* **Portfolio:** 3–5 polished GitHub projects with interactive demos, READMEs, tests
* **Interview Prep:** *Grokking the Machine Learning Interview* — **Educative**
* **Coding Prep:** LeetCode (Medium/Hard), system design exercises

---

# Notes

* Weekly cadence: 10–15 hrs/week part-time, 20+ hrs/week accelerated
* Always maintain GitHub repo with project updates and good READMEs
* Engage in Kaggle competitions for practical exposure
* Use OpenAI Cookbook & Hugging Face labs for daily practice with LLMs
