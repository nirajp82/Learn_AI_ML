### âœ… **Notes / Learning Strategy for Experienced Developers**

* Keep **projects small but deep**â€”focus on **practical coding and reproducible results**.
* Skip long introductory videos; **do exercises first**.
* Maintain **GitHub repo** for all projects; update weekly.
* Integrate **SQL/RDBMS, Python, ML, LLMs, and MLOps** into real projectsâ€”this will keep learning exciting.
* Optional: Participate in Kaggle or Hugging Face competitions for **applied challenges**.

---

This roadmap is now **week-by-week, focused, hands-on**, and designed to avoid boredom while still progressing to **LLMs, agents, and production-grade AI systems**.

---

If you want, I can **also create a version with even more granular daily checkpoints for the first 4â€“6 weeks**, so you can **start immediately without decision fatigue**.

Do you want me to do that next?
